# Description
MedTracker is an android application that helps users keep track of the medications they are taking. It is a calendar like application that has built in alarms with a focus on ease of use for elderly, disabled or forgetful individuals. 

In modern society, despite the development of medical technology has greatly delayed peopleâ€™s lifespan and the difficulty of treating diseases, many senior citizens still struggle with not getting timely treatment. In many cases, this is not because of the lack of medical resources or difficulties in seeking medical care. Sometimes, it is caused by the elderly who just forget to take medicine on time, which causes the treatment interruption.

Since it can be hard for some people to keep track of and stressful to organize, our main goal is to design an application that will do all the heavy lifting for the user to have all information regarding their medications and reminders according to their schedules to ensure no medication is missed, all in the convenience of their mobile device.
